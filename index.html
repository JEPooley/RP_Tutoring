			<h2>
				Special Announcement
			</h2>
			<p>
				In response to the extraordinary requirements 
				which have been placed on all households due to 
				the Covid-19 epidemic, I am pleased to introduce 
				an online maths and physics tuition service which 
				I will be operational by the week beginning Monday 
				23 March for anyone who is interested.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you would like to find out more about this new 
				online service then you will find details by clicking 
				on the tabs above. If you are interested, then the 
				next step would be to arrange a free online 
				consultation to get a feel for this method of 
				tuition and to discuss your requirements in 
				more detail.
			</p>
			<p>				
				The arrival of Covid-19 in our midst has imposed 
				new and strange contingencies on our lives. 
				My normal lessons, conducted at my home are 
				therefore suspended, for the time being.

				If you have a reliable internet connection and 
				a PC or tablet, I am now offering online tuition 
				that utilises an interactive cloud-based 
				whiteboard service.
