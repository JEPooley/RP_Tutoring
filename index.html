					<p>
						Hi, my name is Robert Pooley, and I am a maths tutor working from my home in Devon, England.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am now very pleased to be able to offer all GCSE and A-level maths students an exciting new ONLINE coaching service to supplement their school and sixth-form studies.
					</p>
					<p> 
						I have a wide range of work experience, mainly in software development, acoustics research, and as a craftsman potter, but with brief spells in government administration and farming. I have been tutoring maths and physics for more than ten years. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I have a masters in maths from Cambridge University, and I am a member of the <a href="https://thetutorsassociation.org.uk/" target="_blank">Tutor's Association</a>.

			<h2>
				One-to-one Tuition in the Comfort of your Home
			</h2>

			<p>
				Online tutorials take place on a shared state-of-the-art virtual whiteboard with audio and video link-up to recreate all the benefits of traditional face-to-face coaching. There will be about 50 minutes online teaching within an hourly booking.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just book an hourly slot for your convenience (see below) and meet me on the whiteboard at the time agreed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Full help setting up for first time users makes getting started easy.
			</p>
			<p>
				I offer a free, no-strings introductory setting-up session when we can meet on a whiteboard and discuss your requirements in more detail.
			</p>
			<p>
				The unique advantages of one-to-one tuition mean that the style and content of each and every tutorial can be tailored to your requirements. For instance, I find that many students want a full course of study, whilst others have particular topics which they want to pursue. Many, of course, want immediate help preparing for exams.

			<h2>
				Missed or Cancelled Appointments
			</h2>
	
			<p>
				From time-to-time, students may have to cancel lessons, and I do not charge a cancellation fee.
			</p>
            <p>
				Nevertheless, repeated or persistent cancellation is a charge on my time, as it needlessly denies others the use of the time slot. I would therefore seek to resolve a situation like this with the student and their parent/guardian as soon as a problem is identified.

				Internet Connection

			<p>
				There can, on occasion, be an internet connection problem which means that either a lesson cannot commence, or that a lesson is terminated part-way through.

            <p>
				If there is a connection problem which means that a lesson cannot commence, then this will not be charged.

            <p>
				If connection problems mean that a lesson has to be abandoned having got underway, then the lesson will be charged, but I will make up any lost time at a later time/date.
