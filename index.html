				About Me
			</h2>
			<img src="images/headshot.png" alt="Photo of Robert" width="150px">
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Robert and I am an experienced maths and physics 
				tutor, based in Devon, UK. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I offer professional online tuition for Key Stage 3, GCSE, IGCSE, 
				and A-Level students who are keen to upgrade their maths skills!
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a bachelors degree in maths from Kent university and a 
				masters degree in maths from Cambridge university. I am also a 
				member of the Tutors Association and have full extended DBS 
				accreditation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have enjoyed a varied career since graduating university, 
				including software development, pottery and farming! My most 
				recent work has been on developing innovative audio devices - 
				this included significant study of fluid dynamics and signal 
				processing, as well as designing and building my own speaker 
				systems in the lab! 
			</p>
			<p>
				I started tutoring as a side project about 12 years ago, 
				when my sons and their friends began studying for their GCSEs. 
				In 2018 I decided to carry this on full-time and converted 
				my office into a dedicated tutorial space! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the outbreak of corona virus, earlier this year, I have 
				been offering online maths and physics tutorials to all my 
				students via Skype and an online interactive whiteboard service!

			<h2>
				Getting Started...
			</h2>

			<p>
				Setting up an online lesson with me is straight forward, all 
				you need to do is:

				<ol class='number-ol'>
					<li>
						<img src="images/list_1.svg" alt="">
						Book an appointment (see 'How to Book' below)
					</li>

					<li>
						<img src="images/list_2.svg" alt="">
						Add me on Skype (well before the lesson starts!)
					</li>

					<li>
						<img src="images/list_3.svg" alt="">
						Await my call at the scheduled lesson time
					</li>
				</ol>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				For your first lesson I am offering a 20% discount!

			<h2>
				A Typical Lesson
			</h2>
	
			<p>
				I aim to make lessons as fun, interesting and interactive as 
				possible. To maintain a high level of interactivity for 
				online lessons, I have started using an online whiteboard 
				service. This enables students to try problems, explore 
				solutions and communicate their thoughts visually.
			</p>

			<p>
				In a typical lesson I will usually spend 5-10 minutes 
				introducing a topic, before asking the student a number 
				of questions. This process becomes iterative, as I try to 
				find and extend the conceptual understanding of the student.
			</p>

			<p>
				To emphasise the importance of Maths and nurture an interest in 
				it, I try (where possible) to interlace my lessons with a 'real-
				world' context.
